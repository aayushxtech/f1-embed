# F1-Embed

**F1-Embed** is a Transformer-based deep learning model that learns compact, high-dimensional vector representations (embeddings) of complete Formula 1 laps using raw telemetry data.

Each embedding encodes the driving style, car behavior, and performance characteristics from a lap — enabling driver identification, team classification, similarity search, and lap style analysis.

> Think of it as "Word2Vec for racing laps" — but built from telemetry sequences like speed, throttle, brake, gear, and more.
